>Napoleon's
Influence on Stendhal and His Times</span></b></p>

<p id="p6"><span>The life of French writer Stendhal allows us to understand
the influence of the Napoleonic myth on an entire generation of French youth in
the first years of the nineteenth century. Stendhal (Henri Beyle was his birth
name) was born in Grenoble in 1783, a few years before the French Revolution
broke out in 1789. Instead of pursuing his studies, he joined Napoleon's army
and became thoroughly involved in the Napoleonic adventure across Europe. After
Napoleon's fall, he returned to France only to find himself scorned and
impoverished, as did all of Napoleon's former followers, plunged into disgrace
in the wake of the new Restoration regime. It was during this period that Henri
Beyle devoted himself entirely to literature under the pseudonym of Stendhal.
His first great novel, <i>The Red and the Black</i> (<b><i>Le Rouge et le Noir</i></b>),
was published in 1830. His second, <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i> (<b><i>La
Chartreuse de Parme</i></b>), was published in 1839. In 1842, he fell gravely
ill and died in Paris. Stendhal's fascination with Napoleon had inspired him to
an exceptional destiny, and he devoted his life to the search for happiness.
But, just like his hero Julien Sorel in <i>The Red and the Black</i> who ends
up on the guillotine, Stendhal never really found that happiness and Napoleon's
fall in 1815 was for him a true tragedy.</span></p>

<p id="p7"><span><span>          </span>If Napoleon
influenced the youth and the mentality of his time to such a great extent, it
was because he did not owe his success to his ancestry or family name, and this
was unheard of in his time. Born in 1769 into a Corsican family of rather
modest means, this minor corporal became known for his military victories in
Italy and even Egypt, as well as for his reputedly remarkable intelligence. He
was so close to power only a few years later that he seized it in 1799 through
a coup d'état. He became consul, and then reigned as emperor until 1815. His
reign was marked by permanent war against other European countries, which
considered him a threat against monarchy. Indeed, he invaded most of Europe,
bringing the new ideas of the French Revolution and overthrowing the old
absolute monarchies. His ideas were especially appealing to the youth of the
day that, like Stendhal, saw in Napoleon a Romantic hero fighting for liberty
and progress. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that Napoleon's image
was two-sided: on one hand, he appeared as the young Romantic hero overthrowing
monarchies and leading a revolutionary cause, and on the other hand he gave the
impression of an orderly man who restored a semblance of dynastic monarchy to
France. His designation as emperor and his attempts to promote his own family
to political positions make him, if not a king, a kind of new Caesar who
established a personal and dynastic power. This was why Napoleon at times
appealed to republican revolutionaries and at other times to those who yearned
for the return of a monarchy. The former believed that thanks to him the
darkest hours of the French Revolution were behind them, whereas the latter saw
in him the person responsible for establishing in France a new civil and
economic order. It was Napoleon who for the first time had drafted a strict and
precise civil code guaranteeing the rights as well as specifying the duties of a
French citizen. He also laid the foundations of a new society based not on an
individual's ancestry but on his or her merit. Waterloo marked the end of his
reign and the return to power of Louis XVI's brother who tried to restore the
monarchy just as it existed before the French Revolution. But the memory and
legacy of Napoleon, as Stendhal shows us in his novels, never disappeared and
Napoleon has remained to this day a very strong symbol of the French nation.
The best example of this is probably the <i>Arc de Triomphe</i>, constructed at
one end of the avenue des Champs-Élysées in Paris. It commemorates all
Napoleonic victories, just as the arches of triumph in Antiquity commemorated
the military victories of Ancient Rome. Each victory of Napoleon's army is
engraved in the walls of what is today one of Paris's most famous monuments.</span></p>
