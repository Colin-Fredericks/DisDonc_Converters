  <p id="p7"><b>Le bon vin</b>, <b>le foie gras</b>, <b>la haute couture</b> . . . anyone 
    who hears these few words immediately knows what country is being alluded 
    to. For some people, these words represent&nbsp;the true art of living while 
    for others they signify French elitism. Fashion perfectly embodies these two 
    aspects; it offers chic and beauty to a clientele with the means to accept 
    the offer. However, times are changing and the world of fashion is becoming 
    democratized. Today, the great designers no longer dedicate themselves only 
    to <b>haute couture</b> but also incorporate ready-to-wear fashions. They 
    have learned that a much larger clientele would like to have access to beauty,&nbsp;a 
    privilege, certainly superficial and ephemeral, but one that supplies innumerable 
    women’s magazines with an inexhaustible source of business. Also, in a general 
    sense, fashion is not only the business of the great traditional or avant-garde 
    brands but is also encouraged and distributed by inexpensive clothing chains 
    that very often follow the trends of the great collections.</p>

<p id="p8">&nbsp;</p>

<p id="p9">    How can we explain the importance
of the fashion phenomenon in France? Surely, it results&nbsp;from a long tradition of <b>savoir-faire</b>, nourished
by a mentality open to the pleasures of the senses. Court life consisting of
intrigue and seduction, the prominent role of the arts that sing the beauty of
women, and the Greco-Latin tradition that makes a veritable ethic of inactivity
and contemplation are some of the elements capable of explaining the
phenomenon. Like the Italians who are so close to them, the French are Latins
for whom the sun and colors condition and sharpen a high sense: sight.
Appearance is not simply an illusion; it is, above all else, a promise of beauty.</p>

<p id="p10">&nbsp;</p>

<p id="p11">  Obviously, today, appearance is foremost a promise
of business success. Of course, numerous designers continue to be motivated
by care for the aesthetic and innovation. Often they accompany or even
anticipate changes in society, as when Christian Dior, after the war, created the
“new look” that emancipated women by offering the famous mini-skirt.
Jean-Paul Gaultier, followed later by many others, chose to give a futuristic
dimension to his creations, as did Paco Rabanne, who created dresses&nbsp;from metal. Fashion in
France regularly makes the front page of the newspapers, particularly when
their new summer and winter collections are shown. That is when we see the
greatest models (always popular in France) parade for the greatest names: Agnes
B., Sonia Rykiel, Céline, Christian Lacroix, Chanel . . . The Mecca of fashion
is Paris, and the Avenue Montaigne with its very chic boutiques is the most
luxurious expression of it.</p>

<p id="p12">&nbsp;</p>

<p id="p13">        
  Interestingly, fashion, a phenomenon striking youth first, has become recently a component
of life in low-income suburbs. Recent studies show that young
people in underprivileged neighborhoods are crazy about brand names, often expensive
ones, like Lacoste, for example. Among them it is a sign of recognition and a
more or less voluntary manner of underlining the paradoxes of
the consumer society. Moreover, businesses know very well how to take advantage of
this infatuation. So, if fashions are sometimes born in the suburbs (with rap,
for instance), they are taken up and offered more expensively by the designers! Similarly,
trends initiated by homosexual environments are often adopted by the great brand
names in order to acquire a larger public.</p>

<p id="p14">&nbsp;</p>

<p id="p15">    Globally, a standardization of apparel
fashions can be noted, primarily under American influence.</p>
