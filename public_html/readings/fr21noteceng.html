>The
Far Left in French Politics</span></b><b></b></p>

  <p id="p3"><span>Ever since 1789, France has been viewed by its neighbors as a political 
    country <i>par excellence, </i>one whose people and revolutions consecrate 
    marriage as passionate as they are bloody. More than any other political movement, 
    it is France's far left that embodies the revolutionary tradition of popular 
    struggle, demands, and protest. It emerged in the public consciousness under 
    the prompting of the <i
>Sans-culottes</i>, one of the most seditiously radical groups of the Revolution, 
    and it reappeared during every period of social upheaval — especially in 1830, 
    1848, and 1870 — in which the tragic episode of the Commune created a lasting 
    rupture between the people and the authorities. It stayed alive and, in later 
    years of the 20th century, was maintained through the influence of Communist 
    ideology. In fact, the extreme left in France can be characterized as having 
    developed in accordance with a pattern known as<span>  </span>&quot;sinistro-centrism:&quot; 
    each new movement of the far left always ends up replacing an older one, which 
    then becomes less radical and is gradually pushed back towards the center 
    of the political spectrum. But there always remains a precise movement that 
    can be labeled as “far left.”</span></p>

<p id="p4"><span>What does this extreme left really want? More social
justice, to be attained by protecting the have-nots in general, and the workers
in particular and it insists on an equitable sharing of wealth. It wants
equality, in short — even if that means sacrificing individual freedoms. The
means involved are frequently brutal, contrary to any presumed generosity of
intentions. And herein lie both the drama of and the great paradox of its
mission. It is this drama, and proof of the paradox of its founder, that led
the Communist Soviet Union to carry out the greatest massacres in the history
of humankind. All in the name of humanity's well-being. To make its voice
heard, today's far left stages demonstrations regularly; it organizes strikes
in collaboration with certain unions, participates actively in all social
disputes<span>  </span>— it was, for example, first
in line for the great strikes of 1995.</span></p>

<p id="p5"><span>This extreme left is, in a sense, old-fashioned because it
continues to make reference to a world born out of the Industrial Revolution;
it still resorts to Manichean rhetoric, opposing nasty bosses to nice workers.
It seems incapable of leaving behind obsolete ideas and adjusting its
theoretical thought to the new reality that is represented by the computer age.
And yet, it continues to strike a responsive chord in France. One can
distinguish two movements: the political parties that are very much in the
minority, thinly scattered, fiercely anti-everything, and which often attract
young people in search of ideals; and the French Communist Party (PCF), whose
influence is not inconsequential in French political life — it represented 25%
of the electorate around 1950, and today represents about 9 - 10%.</span></p>

<p id="p6"><span>The first movement comprises diverse small groups such as
Lutte Ouvrière (&quot;Workers' Struggle&quot;), a party that wins about 2% of
the votes when different elections are held — or the Young Communist
Revolutionaries (JCR) — who sell newspapers at the exits of high schools and
universities, and who often have union contacts with the students. Popular and
satirical newspapers like <i>Charlie-Hebdo</i><span
>  </span>(&quot;Charlie's Weekly&quot;) contribute to
making social dissent more widespread. The hour of glory for this particular
extreme-leftist crowd of young militants came in May 1968, when the left
regained its revolutionary reflexes and forced General de Gaulle to dissolve
the Assemblée Nationale. The Communist Party is a more powerful voice of
protest of the two but it is a more disciplined one as well, having chosen to
participate in governmental alliances with the Socialists (in 1980, for the
first time since 1947, and 1997). The Party is needed to stabilize the
coalitions of the left, but does call back into question the issue of unity, as
it routinely denounces the compromises made by the Socialist wing with the
economically powerful. Nonetheless, the margin of action of the PCF remains
reduced. The failure of Communist ideology in the East has caused it to lose
some of its credibility and many of its members. The Party, which once
attracted such great figures from French intellectual life as Jean-Paul Sartre,
can no longer offer anything in the way of an avant-garde, and allows clouds of
doubt regarding its capacities of self-reform to simply linger overhead.</span></p>

<p id="p7"><span>How, then, is the French far left regarded? In a guarded
manner, to be sure, and depending upon whether one happens to be
Socialist-leaning or liberal. But it is interesting to observe that the far
left hardly evokes in France the hate that it evokes in Anglo-Saxon countries.
To imagine a Communist minister or government is quite simply impossible for an
English person, or for an American. For the French it is a reality that no
longer terrifies people. For all those who dismiss Nazi and Communist
totalitarianism as identical, there are numerous others who can distinguish
Stalinism from Maoism, and the egalitarian ideology championed by the French
workers, in whose opinion the workers have, simply put, been betrayed by
pompous and pretentious men.</span></p>

<p id="p8"><span>Finally, one cannot deny that some social benefits have
been obtained under pressure from the far left. But the persistence of a party
whose name remains tied to one of the greatest atrocities in history, however,
remains problematic.<span>  </span></span></p>
