<h5>&nbsp;</h5>

<p id="p6"><span>The euro has been the official currency of France and the
other members of the European Union since January 1, 1999. The launch of this
new European currency marks the last phase in a process of monetary reconciliation
among European countries that began in the mid 1970s after the collapse of the
1944 Bretton Woods Agreement. This agreement was reached in 1944 when several
nations gathered in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to develop structures and
institutions to support a revitalization of the worldwide economy in the wake
of World War II. </span></p>

<p id="p7"><span>The implementation of the euro
as the economic component of the process of European reorganization constitutes
the most spectacular test of Europe's solidity to date. Debates that continue
to agitate European countries testify to the difficulty of this test. In
relinquishing the management of monetary policy to the <b>Banque</b> <b>Centrale
Européenne</b> (<b>BCE</b>) based in Frankfurt, Germany, France and other
members of the European Union renounced a major tool of economic policy in the
hope that increased profits in the future would justify an abandonment of
sovereignty.</span></p>

<p id="p8"><span>The euro presents at least three
advantages for France. First, a unified currency allows for a better
coordination of European monetary policy. Second, the move permits the growth
of a singular European marketplace, which increases consumer buying power
through scaled economies and increased competition. Finally, the euro acts as a
substitute for the dollar in capital markets and, therefore, allows European
states to finance themselves at a lower cost.</span></p>

<p id="p9"><span>Despite the advantages, support
for the euro, like the European Union in general, is far from unanimous in
France. The "yes" brought back from the Treaty of Maastricht referendum in 1992
marked the acceptance by European Union countries to transfer monetary power to
the BCE but came with a sense of upheaval. The ongoing controversy sparked by
the treaty crosses traditional political frontiers; "pro-Europeans" and
"anti-Europeans" can be found in both right-wing and left-wing parties.</span></p>

<p id="p10"><span>The pro-Europeans argue that
because France competes with the significant economic power of American and
other economic giants emerging in Asia, the use of the euro is the only hope
for a bright economic future. They also contend that the European
reorganization will force countries to make necessary structural reforms,
especially at the institutional level.</span></p>

<p id="p11"><span>On the other hand, the
anti-Europeans claim that France risks a dilution of its national identity as
knowledge and economic procedures are shared throughout Europe. They also
assert that the loss of sovereignty exposes the country to unwanted measures
and reforms, particularly those of a social and fiscal nature, resulting from
one of the consequences of successful monetary unification - the mobility of
labor to compensate eventual imbalances in different regions.</span></p>

<p id="p12"><span>What is certain for the moment
is that the "euro zone" of Europe is already heterogeneous in terms of wealth
and beliefs and that no unified monetary policy will be able to satisfy
everyone. However, because France has been at the heart of the unification
process from the start, it knows how to be heard, particularly when French
interests are at stake. For example, at the insistence of the French
government, members of the European Monetary Union were persuaded to name the
former president of the Bank of France as the current vice-president of the <b>BCE</b>.</span></p>
