<p id="p3">French food shopping has undergone major changes since World
War II (WW II). Traditionally, French people shopped for food in small
specialty shops. For example, the <b>boulangerie</b>
made only bread and rolls, the <b>pâtisserie</b>
offered only pastries, and the<b> boucherie
</b>and<b> charcuterie </b>sold fresh
meats. Prior to WWII Shopping was done daily and sometimes before each meal
since these small specialty shops were located in all parts of cities and
towns.</p>

<p id="p4">The revolution in mass merchandizing has since made the
supermarket, <b>le supermarché</b>, and the
large superstore, <b>l’hypermarché</b>, the
mainstay of French food shopping. Part of the switch is also due to the rapid
growth of suburbs around the major cities such as Paris, Lyons, and Marseilles.
Small stores still exist in the cities and towns, but there are fewer than
before. Also, combinations of small shops are increasingly common: <b
>boulangerie-pâtisserie </b>or the<b
> boucherie-charcuterie</b>.</p>

<p id="p5"><b><span
>“Je mets tout ça dans mon
filet</span></b><span>.”</span></p>

<p id="p6">The <b>filet<i
> </i></b><i>(literally,
net)</i> is a mesh bag that French women typically use when they shop for a
day’s food in the city by going to several specialty shops.</p>

<p id="p7"><b></b></p>

<p id="p8"><b><span
>Un kilo / une livre</span></b></p>

<p id="p9">All French measurements (weight, volume, length, liquid, and
temperature) are expressed in the metric system. The base unit of weight is <b
>le gramme </b>(<i>the gram</i>) and is equivalent to about 1/26 of an ounce. The French
took the lead in setting up standards of weights and measures after the French
Revolution (1789). One of the first attempts (1795) was to set the meter at a
fraction of the distance between Dunkerque, England on the northern coast of
France and the Spanish city of Barcelona. A year later the meter was set at
1/10,000,000 of the earth’s surface between the North Pole and the Equator.</p>

<p id="p10">The word <b>kilo</b> is
short for <b>kilogramme</b>, or one
thousand grams. There are .4536 <b>kilogrammes</b>
in a pound (1 pound = 453.6 grams). Thus,<b>
un kilo</b> is about two pounds in weight. The word <b>une livre</b> (<i>a</i> <i
>pound</i>) should not be confused with <b
>un livre</b>, (<i>a</i> <i>book</i>). It is widely
used in France and means half a <b>kilo</b>,
or about 1 U.S. pounds as in, “<b>Une livre
de pommes, s’il vous plaît</b>.”</p>
