<p id="p7">In 1940, France, having lost monumental struggles against
Nazi Germany, decided to sign an armistice with Hitler. The armistice allowed
for the division of France into two zones: the North Zone, occupied by the
Germans, and the South Zone, which was theoretically free and under French
jurisdiction. It was decided that the capital of the South Zone would be Vichy,
a temperate, trendy city in the center of France. The expression
&quot;Vichy&quot; or &quot;Vichy France&quot; is used to describe the
government in France during World War II.</p>

<p id="p8">Delegates met at Vichy and voted to give full constitutional
power in France to Marshal Pétain, a French military leader and World War I
hero, immediately putting an end to the Republic and creating <b>l'État français</b>,
<i>the French</i> <i>State</i>. Pétain became the head of the French State and
with the help of his advisor, Pierre Laval, implemented his politics of <b>révolution
nationale</b>, which were founded on the very conservative platform of
&quot;work, family, country.&quot; Syndicates were banned, all opposition or
democratic activity was prohibited, and the government deliberately
collaborated with Nazi Germany. Vichy government organized roundups and
assisted the Germans in deporting French Jews. The Vichy regime hunted and
condemned to death both Nazi Resistants and Communists. </p>

<p id="p9">In 1944 France was liberated and the Vichy government
collapsed. Pétain had to flee to Germany while Charles de Gaulle (leader of the
French Free Forces during World War II) and the Resistants took power in Paris.
After the defeat of Germany, Pétain and Laval were brought back to France to be
tried for high treason. During the trial, Pétain defended himself by arguing
that his goal was not to collaborate with Germany, but to minimize the damage
of the war for France. He was found guilty and condemned to death. De Gaulle
decided to pardon Pétain, however, because of his age and his heroic
participation in World War I. Pétain died in 1951.</p>

<p id="p10">More than an episode of history in the course of a tragic
period, the Vichy regime still remains a subject of great debate and
controversy in France. For a long time, no one wanted to remember the crimes of
Vichy, which were committed in tacit agreement by a majority in France. Vichy's
participation in the &quot;Final Solution&quot; (the plan of the German Third
Reich to exterminate all Jews) was hidden or downplayed for a long time because
the French people were ashamed. Recently, trials against former civil servants
of Vichy have taken place, and many of the civil servants have been condemned
for crimes against humanity. </p>
