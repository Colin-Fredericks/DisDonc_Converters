>The
University System in France</span></b></p>

<p id="p3"><span>Today, more than ever, the French university system is
under scrutiny from both political and educational perspectives. One major
complaint regarding the system is that since the late 19th century, when it was
first created, the university system has undergone little change. Unlike
secondary education in France, which has maintained a formidable reputation
worldwide, the university system in France has been criticized frequently.</span></p>

<p id="p4"><span>Contrary to universities in most
industrialized countries, French universities are public and open to all. Any
student who has passed <span>the <b>baccalauréat</b></span>
can, if he or she wishes, enroll in the university of his or her choice. In the
first year, the student chooses a subject in which he or she will specialize;
upon completion of his/her studies, the student receives a diploma. The tuition
in French universities is virtually free - the student must generally pay
registration fees of around 800 French francs (the equivalent of $130). The
fees for the university are entirely paid by the state. From the 1800s to the
1950s, the university system in France functioned very well because the number
of students enrolled in the university was very limited.</span></p>

<p id="p5"><span>In the past 30 years, studies
have become progressively more democratic. The number of applicants to the
universities has increased rapidly, and, as a result, universities have found
themselves unable to effectively serve a massive number of with more
personalized attention. French universities have not been well prepared for the
influx of applicants, most of whom pursue advanced degrees in order to obtain
better jobs. The number of students is so great that university diplomas like
the <b><span>Diplôme d'études universitaires
générales</span></b><span> <b>(DEUG)</b></span>
or <span>the <b>Licence </b>(degree
following the <b>DEUG</b> and preceding the <b>Maîtrise</b>) </span>no longer
have the same value in the job market, even though the level of education
remains at the highest level in most French universities. Successive French
governments have refused to reform the system or institute a system to
counteract student unions that are very influential in driving educational and
political debates. Universities are therefore condemned for lacking a means to
resolve these issues.</span></p>

<p id="p6"><span>In response to this problem in
the university system, preparatory classes have been developed to seek out
academically advanced students. These prep courses are classes in which the
best students prepare for entrance exams for prestigious universities, such as <b><span
>l'École polytechnique</span></b> and <b><span
>l'École normale supérieure</span></b><span
>. </span>The number of students admitted in
these classes is very limited and the selection of students by the university
is based on their performance. Once admitted, students study in small classes.
These schools are not universities; they offer a superior level of education
and are generally public and free. The prestige of these schools and of those
who attend them is such that graduates generally have little difficulty finding
good employment. The feeling at these schools is very different from that of
the university - the competition and the work are exceptionally rigorous.</span></p>

<p id="p7"><span>The French university system is
composed of two systems with very different sentiments: on the one hand, there
is the university, which offers education to a large majority of students; on
the other hand, there are schools that tend to be more elitist and offer
education to an extremely limited number of students. The construction of the
university system is a subject of enormous debate in the political world
because the selective way in which students are picked for the more prestigious
schools is perceived as unfair. Hence, the subject of the French university
system is a very sensitive one that the French government has yet to resolve.</span></p>
