<p id="p3">French intervention in Southeast Asia goes back to the
early–19th Century, when Asian converts to Christianity appealed to France to
protect them from persecution. By 1887, after suppressing local uprisings and
battles with the Chinese, who had attempted to claim areas of Southeast Asia,
the French set up the colony of Indochine, which included Vietnam, Laos, and
Cambodia.</p>

<p id="p4" class="MsoBodyText">In 1942, while Vietnam was under
Japanese occupation, Ho Chi Minh founded an independence movement sponsored by
the communists. From 1946 until the<span>  </span>of
the Battle of Diên Biên Phu in 1954, the French fought to maintain their hold
over Vietnam. In 1954 French colonial rule ended, and Vietnam was split into
the Communist north and the Republic of South Vietnam. After Viet Cong
insurgents put the independence of South Vietnam at risk, John F. Kennedy and
the U.S. sent advisors and then troops to support the government of South
Vietnam against the Communists, which lead to the Vietnam War.</p>

<p id="p5">French cultural influence was strong in Vietnam, Cambodia,
and Laos, and many Indochinese had ties to France. For this reason, many
Vietnamese fled to France to escape the communists, and formed a community in
Paris, most notably in the 13th arrondissement. The Vietnamese are one of the
largest components of the Asian community in France, and Vietnamese restaurants
can be found throughout.</p>
