<p id="p1"><b><span>NOTE CULTURELLE</span></b></p>

<p id="p2" align="center"><b><span
>The
Misleading Face of the French Economy</span></b></p>

  <p id="p3">When conversing on the subject of their country today, the French are more 
    likely to wax enthusiastic about their culture than they are to extol the 
    strengths of its economy. And yet France is the fourth mightiest economic 
    power in the world today, just behind the United States, Japan, and Germany. 
    French business enterprises have played a major role in bringing about the 
    phenomenon of global free trade; and, for the past ten or so years, thanks 
    to a positive balance of trade, France has been able to amass enough working 
    capital to finance a commercial expansion into foreign countries. Moreover, 
    France is opening its doors to the numerous foreign investors who are eager 
    to take advantage of its central position within the European Union. </p>

<p id="p4">Though to some extent marginalized, French agriculture
continues to occupy a more than symbolic place within the nation's economic
structure. Largely an exporting activity, it deals chiefly in upscale products,
such as wines. Capitalizing on financial subsidies of European origin, it has
achieved considerable diversity in terms of products, size, and types of
business operation.<span>  </span></p>

  <p id="p5">If French industry periodically experiences an erosion of prestige, it remains 
    substantial, particularly in an era of mergers and acquisitions. Corporate 
    enterprises employ approximately 35% of the nation's workers and include several 
    world or European leaders. Thus, the Franco-Belgian TotalFina Elf is the fourth 
    largest world oil concern in terms of production and reserves. Renault, having 
    acquired the Japanese Nissan, is now the world's fourth largest car manufacturer, 
    and is<b> </b>planning to acquire the Korean Samsung in order to further its<b
> </b>commercial expansion into the emerging markets of Asia. Aventis, born from 
    the merger of Rhône-Poulenc with the German Hoechst Corporation, is a world 
    leader in various proprietary medical products. Aérospatiale, the designer 
    of Airbus planes and the Ariane air shuttle, is headquartered in Toulouse. 
    Lafarge is the leading maker of construction materials in the world; Saint-Gobain 
    ranks among the top three in the sphere of specialty materials (notably, glass).Usinor 
    is preeminent among the world's leading iron and steel groups, and is the 
    foremost European one. <b><span><span
> </span></span></b>France's banking sector, still fairly insular, is forging 
    new alliances at the European level. LVMH is the primary group among the world's 
    top companies specializing in luxury goods, while L'Oréal is number one in 
    the cosmetics domain. In the realm of new technologies, France is admittedly 
    dwarfed by American industries, but has some competitors of very high quality: 
    the Franco-Italian ST Microelectronics is eighth in the world in the field 
    of microprocessors; Cap Gémini is fourth among computer data-processing companies; 
    and Infogrames Entertainment ranks second in the design of video games. The 
    fever of the Internet has France in its grip, and the nation's corporate enterprises 
    are beginning to make up for time lost to the United States in the computer 
    field. In addition, as France happens to be the most visited country in the 
    world, its tourism industry has contributed to the resurgent dynamism of the 
    economy at the end of the 1990s.</p>

<p id="p6">French employers tend generally to emerge from the ranks of
the <b>Grandes Écoles</b>, but a few have come up the ranks as “self-made men”
based on the American model. Among these, François Pinault is without a doubt
the one with the most impressive success story. A true capitalist, he has
switched businesses, partners, and entourages frequently and today, at age
sixty-four, has amassed the country's second largest fortune (valued at
approximately 5 billion euros in 1999).<span> 
</span>Self-taught, the son of a forestry operator, he started out in the wood
business and is now the head of a veritable empire that he directs more and
more towards new technologies.<span>  </span></p>

<p id="p7">In a paradox of the new economic structure, French business
ventures find themselves weakened to some degree by their very success. With
more and more foreigners as shareholders, they have inevitably become
vulnerable to the impact of the sudden mood changes from Wall Street.</p>
