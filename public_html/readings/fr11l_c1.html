<h2>Le Café au Relais du Canal</h2>

<p id="p2">When Régine refers to the <b>Café au Relais du Canal</b>, the word <b>canal</b> in the name of the café refers to the <b>Canal de l’Ourcq</b>. The <b>Canal
de l'Ourcq</b> links the Ourcq River, in northern France, with the city of
Paris. The <b>Canal de l'Ourcq</b> enters
the city through the northeastern neighborhoods at La Villette, where it merges
with the <b>Canal St. Martin</b>, which
connects with the Seine.<span> The</span><b
> Canal de l'Ourcq</b> is 108 kilometers
long.</p>

<p id="p3">The serpentine <b>Canal
St. Martin</b> was built during the Restoration (1814–1830), a period of
restored monarchy that followed the French Revolution<span>.</span>
The <b>Canal St. Martin</b> is 4.8
kilometers long, including a 1.8 kilometer segment that passes through a
tunnel. It meets the Seine at Arsenal, which is now a popular dock for pleasure
boats. </p>

<p id="p6"><b><span>Rue Jomard</span></b></p>

<p id="p7">The <b>rue Jomard</b> is
a small street in the 19th<b>
arrondissement</b><span>,</span> in
northeastern Paris. Traditionally a working-class, industrial area, the entire
arrondissement has undergone a vast urban renewal, spurred by the perennial
Paris housing shortage. The creation of the national science museum, <b>La cité
des Sciences et de l’Industrie</b>, has also attracted people to this part of
Paris. The museum's symbol is the huge polished steel sphere called “<b
>La Géode</b>,” which measures 36 meters in
diameter.</p>

<p id="p8"><b><span>Le Métro</span></b></p>

<p id="p9">In the Conversation, Éliane,
Paul, and Daniel go to the café by taking the <b>Métro Crimée</b>. The Paris subway system, <b>Le Métro</b> (short for <b>Le
Métropolitain</b>), links every neighborhood of the city. The <b
>Métro</b> was the idea of French engineer
Fulgence Bienvenüe (1852–1936), who also supervised its construction. The first
line was opened in 1900; it runs in an east–west direction from the <b
>Porte de Maillot</b> to the <b
>Bois de Vincennes</b>, passing under the <b
>Champs-Élysées</b>. When giving addresses
in the city of Paris, people often mention the nearest subway station. <b
>Crimée (rue de Crimée)</b> is on <b
>Ligne 7 (Villejuif-La Courneuve)</b>.</p>

<p id="p12"><b><span>Les rues de
Paris</span></b></p>

<p id="p13">Paris street names commemorate
famous people, French and foreign cities, and events in history. <b
>Crimée</b> means <i>Crimea</i>, the region of southern Russia where France, Britain, and
the Turks fought against the Russians from 1854 to 1856. This was the war in
which Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing, became famous for
her work among wounded soldiers. Two of the most famous battles of the war, the
Alma River and Sébastopol, are also commemorated in Paris street names: the <b
>Place de l’Alma</b> and the <b
>Boulevard de Sébastopol</b>.</p>

<h4>Faire les courses</h4>

<p id="p14">Urban neighborhoods in France
offer many small specialty food shops, such as bakeries, pastry shops, butcher
shops, dairies, and open-air markets, for daily shopping. However, most French
food shopping is done in supermarkets, and convenience foods play a large role
in food preparation, just as in the United States. When Éliane says, “<b>Je
descends faire</b> <b>les courses</b>,” she is probably going to a supermarket.
The expression <b>faire les courses</b> is used in the context of supermarkets
and stores, while <b>faire le marché</b> is used for shopping at open-air
markets.</p>
