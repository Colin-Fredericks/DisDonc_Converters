>Jean-Marie
Le Pen and the Far Right in French Politics</span></b></p>

<p id="p3">Even if the <b>Front National</b> is a recent phenomenon in
French political life, Jean-Marie Le Pen is not really a newcomer. He is
undeniably the leader of that party, which like any far right movement, is
organized around a charismatic leader with whom each one of its followers
identifies. Jean-Marie Le Pen was born in 1928 to a Breton family of limited
means. His father died fighting in World War II. Since he had no money to pay
for his studies, he enlisted in the army at an early age and participated in
the French war in Indochina as a legionnaire. Once the war ended in 1954, Le
Pen obtained a scholarship and returned to Paris to start law school. He then
associated himself with far right groups of that time and soon became involved
in the nationalistic Poujade movement, a far right backward-looking movement of
the time that complained of the modernization of the economy, mass
merchandising, and the tax system. The Poujade movement obtained good results
in the 1956 legislative elections, and Le Pen was elected deputy at age 28.
Then interest in the movement fell several years later with the advent of
General de Gaulle’s Fifth Republic. Le Pen was not reelected to the assembly.
Nevertheless, his political career had not ended. He continued to be active in
small far right groups that advocated French presence in Algeria and the OAS, a
terrorist organization opposed to Algeria’s independence in the first years of
the 1960s. It was in 1972 that Jean-Marie Le Pen founded his own movement, the <b>Front
National</b>. At the beginning it was only a small far right group like so many
others. In the 1970s, the electoral impact of the <b>Front National</b> was
practically none. Everything changed with the economic crisis of the late
1970s. Le Pen ran in the 1981 presidential elections and obtained a low score:
around 2% of the vote. But in the course of the 1980s and 1990s the <b>Front
National</b> phenomenon took off and reached new heights in the mid-1990s. In
the 1986 legislative elections the <b>Front National</b> succeeded in obtaining
25 deputies. In the 1988 presidential elections, Le Pen obtained 14% of the
vote, a considerable figure and greater than what the far left obtained.
Nevertheless, because of a balloting modification, the <b>Front National</b>
was left with scarcely any deputies and its strategy essentially leaned towards
the presidential election and the mediagenic personality of its leader. In the
1995 presidential elections, Le Pen obtained 16% of the vote.</p>

<p id="p4">The <b>Front National</b> is very often presented as a
racist and xenophobic movement. Indeed, Le Pen’s principal argument is that
immigrants are responsible for the economic crisis, because they take jobs away
from the French or because they are unemployed and therefore costly for the
state. Hence the expansion of the <b>Front National</b> rests essentially on
this argument, which makes immigrants scapegoats and responsible for all the
problems confronting France. For many voters, this idea is attractive because
it throws the responsibility on foreigners. As with most far right political
parties in history, the leader’s eloquence and charisma have great importance.
Obviously Jean-Marie Le Pen has a certain talent as a public speaker that is
attractive to the voting public, perceived as a victim of the economic crisis
and unemployment. He proposes, in addition to returning immigrants to their
countries of origin, withdrawing France from the European Union, raising
salaries considerably, and lowering taxes. His movement’s electoral expansion
these past few years has attracted towards him numerous militants and
conservative figures, as well as solid financial backing.</p>

<p id="p5">The legacy of the <b>Front National</b> in the French
political landscape is difficult to evaluate. It seems that the <b>Front
National</b> is the inheritor of several different movements and that its force
lies in the fact that Le Pen has been capable of uniting all the tendencies
within the far right. The <b>Front National</b> is at the same time the
inheritor of 19th-century ethnocentric nationalism, early 20th-century racist
leagues, and Vichy fascist collaborationism. It is essentially a
backward-looking movement that attracts older voters or those left behind by
the economy’s evolution. The more there are people who feel rejected or misunderstood
in the modern world, the stronger the <b>Front National </b>becomes.</p>

<p id="p6">Until now, the traditional right has always refused
electoral alliances or agreements with the far right, which has prevented the <b>Front
National</b> from reaching office and has forced it to remain marginalized.</p>
