>LANGUE ET CULTURE 1</span></b></p>

<h3>Le bol</h3>

<p id="p2">In French homes, breakfast coffee is usually served in a
bowl without handles and is usually black and very strong. <span
>m</span>ost people add sugar, but not milk or
cream. The traditional French breakfast consists of coffee, and bread or
croissants with butter or jam. Meat and eggs are usually not eaten in the
morning. In recent decades, American cereals have become popular, especially
with children.</p>

<h3>Le croissant</h3>

<p id="p3">These flaky French crescent rolls have become staples of the
American pastry repertoire over the last 20 years. The word <b
>croissant</b> has an interesting history.
Although most people think of croissants as quintessentially French, they first
came to France from Vienna in the 19th century. The French word <b
>croissant</b> is a translation of the
German word <i>Hörnchen.</i> Croissants were
created in Vienna to celebrate the victory over the Turks in 1689. The shape of
the pastry imitates the crescent moon, the Turkish national symbol.</p>

<p id="p4"><b><span
>Le ticket de Métro</span></b></p>

<p id="p5">This borrowing from English is usually limited to tickets
used on buses and subways. For most other kinds of tickets, French uses the
word <b>le billet</b>. The word “ticket” is
a good example of how English and French vocabularies influence each other. In
the <b>Conversation</b> and <b
>Un peu plus</b> sections you will see the
French words <b>croissant</b>,<b
> rendez-vous</b>,<b> message</b>,<b> bizarre</b>, and <b
>station</b>, all of which have found their
way into English. Likewise, the French word <b>céréale</b><span>,</span> which
always existed in the language, has now acquired from English the meaning <i>breakfast
cereal</i>. </p>

<p id="p6"><b><span
>Crimée</span></b></p>

<p id="p7">See <b>Préparation 11</b>
for a note on <b>Crimée </b>and the Crimean
War.</p>

<p id="p8"><b><span
>Stalingrad</span></b></p>

<p id="p9">The battle of Stalingrad was fought between Germany and the
Soviet Union during World War II. This long and bloody confrontation lasted
from September of 1942 to February 2, 1943, when the German troops surrendered
to the Russians. Stalingrad was the turning point of the war on the Russian
front, and marked the beginning of the slow and bitter fight to drive the
invading Nazis from Russia. The city of Stalingrad, located on the Volga River,
is today called Volgograd.</p>

<p id="p10"><b><span
>Gare de l’Est</span></b></p>

<p id="p11">The <b>Gare de l’Est</b>
is one of the largest railway stations in Paris. Trains leave from the <b
>Gare de l'Est</b> for Central and Eastern
Europe.</p>

<p id="p12"><b><span
>La direction</span></b></p>

<p id="p13">Métro lines, although officially numbered, are more commonly
referred to by their terminal stations. Thus, the line that stops at <b
>Crimée</b> is number 7, but is called <b
>La Courneuve-Villejuif</b> to indicate the
final stops at either end. On the platforms the signs say <b>Direction La Courneuve</b> or <b>Direction
Villejuif </b>to specify the direction in which the train is traveling.</p>

<p id="p14"><b><span
>Bobigny</span></b></p>

<p id="p15">Bobigny is a suburban city just northeast of Paris. It is a
center of the French automobile industry.</p>

<p id="p16"><b><span lang="FR
">Place
de la République</span></b></p>

<p id="p17">Every French city and town has its own <b>Place de la République</b>. The Paris<b> Place de la République</b> is a huge square that was laid out in the
eastern part of the city in 1854 by Baron Georges Haussmann, whose major
construction projects transformed the city of Paris. Haussmann planned the
large avenues branching out from the <b>Place
de la Répulique</b> to be able to carry troops into this rough and
insurrection-prone part of working-class Paris.</p>
