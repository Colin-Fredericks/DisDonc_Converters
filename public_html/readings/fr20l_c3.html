  <p id="p3">French North Africa is often called by its Arabic name <b
>le Maghreb</b> and people from North Africa are <b>maghrébins </b>(<span
>feminine:</span> <b>maghrébine</b>). The Arab population of France (including 
    the French-born children of the immigrants) is estimated at over 4,000,000. 
    One of the characters in the <b>Conversation</b>, Karim Halibi is a <b>maghrébin</b>.</p>

  <p id="p4">France has a large Arab and Muslim population, most of whom come from the 
    country's former North African colonies: Morocco (<b
>le Maroc</b>), Algeria (<b
>l’Algérie</b>), and Tunisia (<b
>la Tunisie</b>). French colonization in Africa dates back to the 1800's when 
    French forces captured the city of Algiers (<b>Alger</b>). By 1848, the Algerian 
    coast had been divided into <b>départements</b>, and was considered part of 
    France. Tunisia became a French protectorate in 1881, Morocco in 1912. </p>

<p id="p5">Decolonization came relatively easily to Morocco and
Tunisia, which became independent in 1956. In Algeria, however, the struggle
for independence was much more difficult. Algeria was considered part of France
and had a French population of nearly one million. The French colonists had
strong ties to Algeria and were reluctant to give up their claims. The
resistance against Algerian independence led to the bloody Algerian War, 1954 –
1962 (<b>la Guerre d’Algérie</b>). The war
resulted in 300,000 to 600,000 deaths and led to the abandonment of Algeria by
its French population.</p>
