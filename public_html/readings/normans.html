>The
year 1066 was a turning point in history. William I, the Conqueror and his sons
conquered England from their base in Normandy, fundamentally changing England's
government, language, and social order. Norman feudalism became the basis for
the conquerors' division of English lands among themselves. This gave England a
new French aristocracy and a new social and political structure, ending
England's previous Scandinavian ways. </span></p>

<p id="p4"><span>William the Conqueror imposed
his native language, French, on England. As a result, French, a Romance
language derived from Latin, became the language of the English upper class.
The English kings spoke French as their native tongue, and not until the 14th
century did the kings speak English. A revival of English culture did take
place in the mid-12th century, but French remained the dominant language of
Parliament and the law courts into the 13th century. French has so influenced
the English vocabulary that, even though English is a Germanic language,
English speakers today recognize the meanings of more French words than German
words.</span></p>
