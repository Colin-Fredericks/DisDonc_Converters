Eiffel (1832–1923), the engineer who designed the Eiffel Tower. The Tower, a
metal structure, was completed in 1889 and is 320 meters (about 1,050 feet)
high. Today the Eiffel Tower is perhaps the most well-known symbol of the city
of Paris, but when it was built for the 1889 World’s Fair, it called forth a
storm of criticism that condemned it as a blight on the beauty of the city.
Today over 170 million people visit the Eiffel Tower each year to enjoy the
spectacular views of Paris from the observation deck at the top.</span></p>

building the Eiffel Tower by himself. The actual construction of la Tour Eiffel
employed over 200 workers, half of whom made the iron girders while the other
half worked on the tower.</span></p>
