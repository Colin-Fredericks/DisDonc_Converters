<p id="p4"><span>Since decolonization, it is evident that the French
population and its values have greatly changed. The primary reason for this
change is that the French population, which fifty years ago was largely
Catholic and European, has changed due to the significant immigration that it
experienced in the 1960s and 1970s.</span></p>

<p id="p5"><span>After the decolonization of
France's last big colony, Algeria, General de Gaulle (then president of France)
wanted to launch the country into a movement of economic development,
modernization, and industrialization. Nevertheless, the available French work
force was declining, and it was necessary to call upon the manpower of
immigrants from France's former colonies, notably North and Central Africa. The
number of immigrants from these countries who came to France was large, and the
issue of language did not pose a problem because French is one of the official
languages - often the only official language - of many countries in North and
Central Africa. Until 1975, only men were able to go work in France for a few
years in the hope of returning to their native countries some time later with
more money. But this posed a number of humanitarian problems, and in 1975 the
French government accepted family regrouping; in other words, the families of
workers were also permitted to immigrate to France. With the arrival of an
economic crisis at the same time, all immigration for work purposes was
forbidden due to unemployment. It was at this time that there was a transition
in France from a work-related immigration to one of foreigners coming to live
in France and become French.</span></p>

<p id="p6"><span>It is necessary to recognize
that France had not been a land of immigration, contrary, for example, to the
United States. It was consequently ill-prepared to acquire and integrate a
population of foreigners. There had previously been an immigration of peoples
of European descent (Italian, Spanish, Belgian), but not one of peoples whose
cultures were more different and remote. These immigrants soon found themselves
on the bottom rung of French society because of their cultural and physical
differences. The major problem was and remains a religious one: Islam quickly
became the second religion in France, currently with three million followers
there. Although France does not have an official religion, the society was
founded on Catholic values; this created an obvious tension between the values
of the immigrant populations and those shared by the majority of the French.
Furthermore, because of the economic crisis, the immigrants were first to fall
into obscurity and poverty, living in poor suburbs that are often compared to
ghettos. In brief, French society has proven incapable of truly integrating and
accepting these populations. In the 1980s, a number of racist movements
emerged; notably, <b>le Front national</b> gathered a large following in
regions where there was a large immigrant population.</span></p>

<p id="p7"><span>It seems that today integration
is occurring gradually. The second and third generations of immigrants have
many fewer difficulties in finding work or attending top schools. For example,
a couple of years ago a second generation Algerian received first place in the
entrance exam to the <b>École normale supérieure</b>, one of the most
prestigious and competitive schools in France. Another immigrant who has
attracted a lot of positive attention in the past few years is Zidane, a soccer
player who is the son of Algerian immigrants from Marseille. The examples are
infinite, but big problems exist and sometimes occasionally create a true
identity crisis for French society. Recently, a controversial debate occurred
over the issue of young Muslim girls who wear a veil to school, because this is
considered a religious symbol that conflicts with the secular nature of the
French public school system. These young girls were therefore sent home, an act
that consequently elicited a terrible reaction from the Muslim community.</span></p>

<p id="p8"><span>The presence in France of these
new populations is therefore seen as a true challenge for the society and as a
reminder of a colonial heritage that no one can deny.</span></p>
