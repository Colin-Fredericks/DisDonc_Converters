<h1>LANGUE ET CULTURE 2</h1>

<p id="p1">In the 6th and 7th centuries B.C., the Celts conquered parts
of Asia and most of Europe, including what is now France. France was then known
as “Gallia,” and although the region was eventually latinized, Celtic words
remained part of the French language and are still used today. For example, <b>le
berceau</b>, <i>cradle</i>, and <b>brasser</b>, <i>to brew beer</i>, are Celtic
words, and several names of French cities, such as Paris, Lyon, Poitiers, and
Amiens, are derived from Celtic tribal names or the names of fortified Celtic
towns.</p>

<p id="p2">Before the Germanic invasion, Britain was also a
Celtic-speaking country and, as a result, there are remnants of the Celtic
language in English. The English word <i>score</i> reflects the Celtic system
of counting by twenties as in <i>four score and seven</i>, which is equivalent
to the French <b>quatre-vingt-sept</b>.</p>
