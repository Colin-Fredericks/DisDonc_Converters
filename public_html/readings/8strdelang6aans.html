<p id="p2">In the French questions, the prepositions come at the
beginning of the sentence, and before their objects (in these cases, the
question words).</p>

<p id="p3">In the English sentences the preposition is separated from its
object (the question word) and is placed at the end of the sentence.</p>

<p id="p4">In French, prepositions always come before their objects,
whether those objects are nouns, pronouns, or question words. In English
prepositions are often separated from their object when that object is a
question word and is placed at the end of the question.</p>
