French Republic and its Symbols</span></b></p>

<p id="p5">&nbsp;</p>

<p id="p6">&nbsp;</p>

<p id="p7">Numerous symbols, firmly anchored in French mentality, are
attached to the French Republic. Most of those symbols come to us directly from
the French Revolution (1789), although some are still more ancient. Above all,
the Republic is evoked by <b>Marianne</b>, the tri-color flag and, of course,
the national anthem.</p>

<p id="p8">&nbsp;</p>

<p id="p9">Represented with a sack of wheat at her feet, <b>Marianne</b>
does not care about power but about the aspirations of the French people.
Since 1789, <b>Marianne</b> is often shown wearing a Phrygian bonnet and
carrying a pikestaff — a reference to her distant origins: in Antiquity, freed
slaves of the Roman Empire wore the Phrygian bonnet. <b>Marianne</b> is
portrayed as a warrior, which also recalls the Greek Athena and symbolizes the
fact that freedom comes through the use of weapons. During the Napoleonic
Empire (First Empire: 1804-1814) and the Restoration (1814-1830), <b>Marianne </b>became less 
significant. But her most famous representation is undoubtedly that of Eugène 
Delacroix, the celebrated painter of the Romantic school, in <strong>"La liberté 
guidant le peuple aux barricades"&nbsp; </strong> (“<i>Liberty Leading the People
at the Barricades</i>”) (1830). In 1852 Napoleon III (Second Empire,
1852-1870) replaced <b>Marianne</b>     with his own effigy on
coins and stamps. The Commune (1871) and the Third Republic (1870-1940) gave <b>Marianne</b> back her symbolic importance, which is still 
evolving. All French city halls have a bust of <strong>Marianne</strong>, often 
sculpted with the features of Brigitte Bardot or Catherine Deneuve. The symbolic 
power of <strong>Marianne </strong>       
        is reinforced proportionately
to the affirmation of the concept of the French nation.</p>

<p id="p10">&nbsp;</p>

<p id="p11">Several versions exist of the 
interpretation of the three colors of the French flag. The most widespread 
belief is that of the blue as the sky of “sweet France,” the white as the lilies 
of kings, and the red as the blood spilled for liberty. In the armies the white 
flag was the insignia of the colonel who represented the king. White, therefore, 
becomes the color of royalty. Three days after the taking of the Bastille (July 
14, 1789), Louis XVI went to greet the new city government at the Hôtel de 
Ville. Arriving at the square, he found the façades draped in unfamiliar flags: 
blue and red <span 
>—</span> 
that had become the colors of the capital <span 
>—</span>        
              
                
             
            
             
              
             
      on either side of the royal white. The three
colors thus became symbols of the French Republic but were not arranged
definitively in the form of three vertical bands until 1812.</p>

<p id="p12">&nbsp;</p>

<p id="p13">The French national anthem came into 
existence in Strasbourg, composed by Captain Rouget de Lisle to cheer on the 
Army of the Rhine leaving for the front at Valmy. The anthem has the name 
"Marseillaise" because it was sung by a group of 500 volunteers from Marseilles 
going to Paris to participate in the taking of the Palace of the Tuileries. 
Parisians, seeing those soldiers from Marseilles marching by singing those 
verses, gave the name of <strong> "Marseillaise</strong><strong>" </strong>       
             
            
              
            
           
  to that song. In spite of the violence of the words of this
song (for example, the famous <b><span><strong>"</strong>Qu’un
sang impur abreuve nos sillons</span>"&nbsp; </b>[“<i>May the blood of the defiler
drench our land</i>”]), it has remained dear to the hearts of the French, and 
the President of the Republic, Valéry Giscard D’estaing, unleashed a tempest of 
protests when during the 1970s he wanted the <strong>"Marseillaise"</strong>
played at a slower tempo. However, although the idea of changing the words of
the anthem to soften them regularly reappears, it has not yet been put into
practice.</p>

<p id="p14">&nbsp;</p>

<p id="p15">If the Vichy period of the Second World War is excluded, the
French Republic has remained stable, and all the French acknowledge that. The
symbols attached to it have gone beyond the frontiers of the country, and the
national anthem, like the tricolor flag or even <b>Marianne </b>
(undoubtedly due to the world-famous Delacroix painting), are certainly among the most easily
recognizable symbols in the world.</p>
