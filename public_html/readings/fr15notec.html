Gaulle</span></b></p>

<p id="p3">Charles de Gaulle was born in Lille in 1890. At the age of
20, he entered a military school in Saint-Cyr and a few years later served as a
junior officer in World War I. After the war, he worked in the Ministry of War
and became the personal secretary to Minister Marshal Pétain. When World War II
broke out, de Gaulle was named colonel and given the provisional title of
general. After the government agreed to an armistice with Germany, de Gaulle
voiced his disapproval, insisting than an armistice would humiliate France. </p>

<p id="p4">De Gaulle then fled to England, where he delivered what is
known as &quot;the appeal of June 18, 1940.&quot; By radio, de Gaulle asked
that all French citizens refuse to subjugate themselves to the Germans and
Pétain and join him in England to fight on the side of the Allies. This act,
which today seems very patriotic, was at that time deemed little more than an
act of rebellion, worthy of an adventurous man. Very few people joined de
Gaulle initially. Little by little, however, with the help of the English, de
Gaulle made himself known as the head of the resistance. </p>

<p id="p5">When North Africa was seized by the Allies, de Gaulle
installed a government in Algeria and prepared to take power after the
liberation of France. After Paris was liberated in August 1944, de Gaulle
installed and acted as head of a provisional government in the French Republic.
The new constitution that was instituted, however, displeased de Gaulle and he
resigned, retiring to his house in <b>Colombey-les-deux-églises</b>,<b> </b>in
Lorraine, where he wrote his famous account of World War II: <b><i>Mémoires de
guerre</i></b>. </p>

<p id="p6">In 1958 de Gaulle resurfaced on the political scene to
assist France during the Algerian <span>w</span>ar.
He agreed to do so on the condition that he be given the power to change the
Constitution. De Gaulle then put into place the regime of the "Fifth Republic"<i>
</i>and instituted a policy of universal suffrage, which gave all French
citizens the opportunity to vote. De Gaulle was elected the first president of
France in 1958. His popularity deteriorated, however, when the student
movements of 1968 escalated, and he retired in 1969.</p>

<p id="p7">In his later years, de Gaulle's political beliefs came under
attack. His brand of nationalism was deemed old-fashioned and inappropriate in
the modern world. His visionary views of politics stood in stark contrast to
the type of nationalism he espoused. This is why there are a number of debates
on the political orientation of de Gaulle. What is certain is that de Gaulle
was one of the most influential men of his time. </p>
