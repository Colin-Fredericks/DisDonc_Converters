<p id="p5" class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p id="p6" class=MsoNormal>Confronted by a serious problem of unemployment since the
end of the 1970s (the rate of unemployment was more than 12% of the working
population in the mid-90s), successive French governments have been elected by
promising to put an end to the problem . . . and as yet have not
succeeded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the legislative elections
of June 1997, the Socialist Party, led by Lionel Jospin, proposed reducing the
work week from 39 hours to 35 hours in order to better “distribute” the work.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Rather surprisingly winning the majority in
the National Assembly, newly elected Prime Minister Jospin, heading a coalition
of the Socialist Party, the Communist Party and the Green Party (called a
“plural” majority), had to work all the more rapidly to put this controversial
reform into operation because it was one of the rare ones to receive
quasi-unanimity in his governmental majority.</p>

<p id="p7" class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p id="p8" class=MsoNormal>The simple idea behind the so-called “35-hour reform” is
that by reducing the weekly work time by approximately 10%, employment will
automatically be offered to the unemployed thanks to the positions thus freed
up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The reform consists of setting the
amount of work time per week at 35 hours as of January 1, 2000 for businesses
with more than 20 employees and in January 2002 for all others.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To give flexibility to the plan, schedules
may be arranged so that, on average, the 35 hours will be respected for one
year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For example, the reduction in
work time may be taken in the form of more days off.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>This latter provision was kept, for example, in the case of
executives who enjoy autonomy in the management of their time and who, in
practice, widely exceed the number of legal working hours.</p>

<p id="p9" class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p id="p10" class=MsoNormal>The reform has been actively debated and frequently
contested.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>First of all, at the political
level, government opponents did not fail to point out that France did not need
any more regulation and that it would not emerge from the problem of
unemployment by remaining in a “managed” economy.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It is true that the effects of the reform would not be automatic
since the amount of work in an economy is not a constant to be divided one way
or another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In some sectors, workers
have expressed fears that their income will be reduced due to the reduction of
hours and, conversely, the heads of businesses have often stated that the
reform would increase the cost of wages and, due to that fact, would be
counter-productive as it would add to the problem of a minimum wage which is
already too high for their tastes.</p>

<p id="p11" class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p id="p12" class=MsoNormal>The first appraisal of the reform was somewhat mixed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was written up, it is true, in a period
of decline in the rate of unemployment, but economists agree that this decline
is more the fruit of better economic circumstances than of any governmental reform.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The reform did indeed have effects, but not
necessarily those that were anticipated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>First of all, negotiations permitted the renewal of dialogue within
companies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Next, one of the merits of
the law was probably that of encouraging management and labor unions to
consider together essential questions concerning the competitiveness of
businesses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The reform was often the
occasion for imposing more flexibility on wage-earners (work on weekends or
excessive schedules), which meant that the beneficiaries were not, perhaps, the
ones intended in the beginning . . .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Finally, the reduction of work time in the public sector, a cause for
amusement because of slight productivity in that area, still has to be
legislated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the former Finance
Minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn said privately and jokingly, “as for the 35
hours in government services, we are going to go slowly: 29, 30, 31 . . .
”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The reform promises to be a subject
of discussion for several years to come.</p>
