"Trebuchet MS"'>A Government Still Very Much a Force in the Economy</span></b></p>

<p id="p5" class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p id="p6" class=MsoNormal>Among the Western democracies, one of the characteristics
that distinguishes France from the others is that the government regulates the
economy and is also the major player in it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The centralizing, Colbertian tradition of an all-powerful government is
still very much alive, even if it is gradually being weakened under the
influence of the European Union in particular and of popular discontent in the
face of the government’s opposition to progress where institutional reforms are
concerned.</p>

<p id="p7" class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

  <p id="p8" class=MsoNormal>Numerous sectors are still run by the government. The majority 
    of education in France is public at all levels, and the most prestigious schools 
    are public. (Moreover, they are the schools in which civil servants are educated!)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The French are devoted to this system, for it is perceived as being 
    a factor in the equalization of opportunities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The same goes for the field of health, where most hospitals and the 
    medical insurance system (Social Security) are public.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>However, an aging population and more and more expensive care are making 
    modernization of the structure of this sector necessary, although it is slow 
    in coming about since it would be politically very risky. The government is 
    also at the heart of the retirement system, which is based on the principle 
    of sharing – the pensions of retirees are financed by the working population. 
    As has been known for a long time, the system is not viable at mid-term for 
    demographic reasons, but a serious reform introducing a funded pension plan 
    and lengthening the time for paying into the system is still a long way off.</p>

<p id="p9" class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p id="p10" class=MsoNormal>France is also remarkable for its redistribution system,
which is very generous compared to American standards. At the end of the 1980s,
the Revenu Minimum d’Insertion (income support system) (RMI) was created for an
amount of approximately 400 euros per month for a single person, paid out to
persons of 25 years and older who are without resources.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Housing allotments are also paid to those
whose incomes are too small to permit them to pay for housing, and so-called
“family” allotments are paid to parents with dependent children.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>France also has a very active public housing
policy through the Habitations á Loyer Modéré (moderate rental housing) (HLM),
intended for low-income households.</p>

<p id="p11" class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p id="p12" class=MsoNormal>When he became president of the republic in 1981, François
Mitterand shocked the nation by nationalizing numerous large companies. Since
1986, those same businesses, one after the other, have been re-privatized, thus
diminishing the direct power of the government in industrial matters. Today,
the government remains the owner of a few banks and medium-sized insurance
companies, the majority of national transportation infrastructures (railways,
highways, ports, etc.); and the largest producer of electricity in the world,
Electricité de France (EDF); and it is a majority shareholder in several
partially privatized businesses such as France Telecom. Continuing with
privatization will allow for reduction of the government debt load or for financing
the retirement system.</p>

<p id="p13" class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p id="p14" class=MsoNormal>The greatest counterbalance to the French state is or soon
will be the European Union, which, in addition to monetary power, will from now
on concentrate on regulatory power concerning competition.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus, Government monopolies of telephone
services or electricity will have to be abolished.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>In the areas where the government remains in charge in principle,
particularly in fiscal matters, there is increasing talk of the need for conformity
with the rest of Europe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the whole,
a more liberal consensus is appearing in France, as witnessed by the recent
acknowledgment of the Socialist Prime Minister that, faced with massive layoffs
in some industries, “The government can’t do everything.&quot;</p>
