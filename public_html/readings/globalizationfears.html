Fears of Economic Globalization</span></b></p>

<p id="p6"><span>For quite a few years now, the French have been expressing
distrust and skepticism concerning the theoretical benefits of economic
globalization as defined in classic textbooks on international economics.
Indeed, in a country very widely affected by unemployment since the end of the
1980s - even at the start of the year 2000, France's unemployment rate hovered
around 11% - economic globalization means heightened competition and the
shifting of economic activity to countries where lower wages are the norm.
Numerous sectors of the French economy, such as the steel industry, have had to
undergo painful reforms, and certain others, such as the textile and
shipbuilding industries, have practically disappeared. Furthermore, the French
fear that the increase in the volume and speed of global exchanges will call
into question France's national sovereignty. In a country so proud of its
traditions and culture, it is a particular way of life more than anything, that
the modern economic structure threatens, and the dispute is becoming more
intense all the time.</span></p>

<p id="p7"><span>In the cultural realm, the
growing domination of the English language and of American cultural products
has repeatedly forced the French government to take draconian measures to
encourage the use of the French language and support French creative
initiatives. Since the mid-1980s, quotas have been imposed on French television
networks and radio stations, and an original system for the funding of French film
productions was established in order to prevent the total disappearance of
French cinema. The <b>Académie française</b>, a body of French language experts
that determines French linguistic standards, regularly suggests alternative
terms in French for English words and expressions (such as "start-up" or "Web,"
for example) and the use of these terms is sometimes subsequently mandated by
law.</span></p>

<p id="p8"><span>France recently found an
anti-globalization hero in a sheep breeder named José Bové who made himself
known when he led an assault in August 1999 to ransack a McDonald's</span><span
><span>ä</span></span><span> restaurant that was being constructed. Indeed, this
fast-food chain was targeted as a symbol of the United States and of what Mr.
Bové calls "the bad food multinationals." A series of problems associated with
food and health (the Mad Cow epidemic in Great Britain, dioxin-contaminated
chickens in Belgium, etc.) made consumers very sensitive to this topic and
resulted in a generalized anguish over any type of manipulation of nature. It
is this mentality that urged Europe to maintain its prohibition of imports of
beef treated with growth hormone. This action led to the July 1999 U.S.
decision to impose customs duties of 100% on certain European food products,
among them Roquefort cheese and foie gras, products symbolic of France and very
dear to the French. Mr. Bové's rebellion was primarily a reaction to the loss
inflicted on small producers of Roquefort.</span></p>

<p id="p9"><span>Today it is the Internet that
best embodies the ideal of a planet without borders, and therefore new technologies,
which have the potential to dangerously infringe on certain aspects of private
life, have naturally also become an object of debate. The French have enacted
several laws aiming to limit if not prohibit the circulation of information
about private life with any country deemed incapable of offering sufficient
protection from potential infraction.</span></p>

<p id="p10"><span>At the dawn of the 21st century,
the French are asking themselves how to best preserve political primacy over
the economy, a difficult challenge indeed.</span></p>
