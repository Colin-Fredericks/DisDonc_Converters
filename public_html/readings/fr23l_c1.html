TGV</span></b></p>

<p id="p3">The <b>TGV</b>, <b>le train à grande vitesse</b>, has
revolutionized transportation in Europe. The <b>SNCF</b> began creating the <b>TGV</b>
rail network in the late 1960s. By the early 1980s, the Paris-Lyon line was
operational and became an instant success. It reduced rail time between
France’s two largest cities from nearly four hours to two hours and five
minutes. The <b>TGV</b> eliminated the need for extensive air service between
Paris and Lyon, since business travelers could now commute by rail between the
downtown areas of the two cities. Since the 1980s, the <b>SNCF</b> has expanded
service to include all of France, as well as Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany,
Spain, Switzerland, and Italy. The construction of the tunnel under the English
Channel has allowed for a 3 hour <b>TGV</b> rail connection between London and
Paris.</p>
