  <p id="p6">The “politically correct” love euphemisms. For several years now, we have 
    not spoken of tramps and vagrants, but of “homeless people” or of “those with 
    no permanent address” (the infamous 'sans-domicile-fixe'<b> </b>(<b>SDF</b>). 
    In exactly the same way, we hesitate to speak of illegal or clandestine immigrants 
    and prefer the designation “without papers.” But, in fact, euphemisms change 
    nothing at all; at the very heart of our society of affluence and recognition 
    of rights, groups of men and women are emerging who are defined by alienation 
    and exclusion. These are the “withouts.” Worse, the triteness of the "<strong>SDF</strong>" 
    and “without papers” expressions tends to institutionalize these categories 
    and to make them the subject of sociological studies, among other things, 
    thus partially causing the reality to be passively accepted rather than combatted.</p>

<p id="p7">&nbsp;</p>

  <p id="p8">The problem of the <b>SDF</b> has, in few years, become the symptom of a 
    profound social dysfunction. Note that these “new poor,” as they are sometimes 
    called, have become more and more numerous on the sidewalks of French cities 
    since the 1980s, the period that witnessed the arrival of the socialist and 
    supposedly humanistic left in power (1981). Who is responsible? Certainly, 
    the entire responsibility cannot be attributed to socialist governments. On 
    one hand, this is the case because the right was in power for six of the last 
    twenty years. On the other hand, the cause is essentially economic; the crisis 
    of the seventies created a great precariousness in the labor market and considerably 
    increased the number of unemployed and, consequently, the homeless. Nevertheless, 
    socialist governments have not been able to resolve the problem. Frequently, 
    charitable associations have taken up the slack from a government powerless 
    to halt the crisis. The best example is the creation by <b>Coluche</b> (a 
    comedian very popular at that time, but deceased now) in 1985 of the <b><span
>Restos du Coeur</span></b>, a voluntary&nbsp;organization for distribution of 
    free meals for the disenfranchised. The <b><span
>Restos du Coeur</span></b> has been a success for fifteen years and each winter 
    assures a minimum of care for the homeless. But this quasi-institution is 
    based entirely on gifts from citizens and not on aid from the government. 
    Other charitable associations like <b><span
>ATD Quart Monde</span></b> bring together numerous anonymous benefactors and 
    celebrities to defend the rights of the outcasts of society. This association 
    came to prominence at the time of the occupation of empty housing in Paris. 
    Such episodes are, in fact, representative of the paradoxes of the Welfare 
    State: on one hand, undeniable national wealth and, on the other hand, the 
    inability to supply lodging to all inhabitants. However, putting faith in 
    the celebration of these associations by the media would be too simple and 
    to think that the government does nothing to combat poverty, erroneous. For 
    example, in 1998 the socialist government of Lionel Jospin passed a law said 
    to fight against disenfranchisement that should contribute to helping persons 
    in precarious situations.</p>

<p id="p9">&nbsp;</p>

<p id="p10">Another thorny problem for the conscience of leftist
governments is the legalization of illegal immigrants. There, also, the
generous and egalitarian ideal must be combined with a necessary political
pragmatism. Since 1996, those without papers and those who defend them have
mobilized to obtain the legalization of their status.<span>&nbsp; </span>Demonstrations of support are held regularly, along with
occupations of churches and hunger strikes; French television has been
inundated with scenes from these protests. After the <b>Debré</b>  
 law proposed by the Right in 1997, which was intended to verify and index
persons taking in foreign visitors, the Left tried to regulate the fate
of these disenfranchised ones. But out of 140,000 requests for legalization, only
63,000 have been accepted. Some people even accuse the government of having
undertaken this vast operation in order to better update the files of
foreigners in illegal situations and render them even more vulnerable. Whatever the case,
the “management of migratory flow”&nbsp;will soon be under the aegis of the European
Union, making autonomy of decisions in this field more difficult.</p>
