      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        The basic building blocks of any language are its sounds. Learning to
        pronounce a language accurately not only helps you to be understood,
        but also makes you aware of sounds and meanings so you can understand
        others. Every language is different and has its own complexities.
        French has a sound system that is very different from that of English,
        yet the French and English languages have a lot in common. Listen to
        the following conversation between two French people. If you have
        never studied French, what you hear will seem like a jumble of strange
        sounds uttered at an incredible speed.

      <h2>English vs. French</h2>

      <h3>French Sounds</h3>

      <p>
        It may be difficult to believe, but the conversation you just heard
        contained many words that are similar to English equivalents in
        spelling and meaning. You probably didn’t recognize these words
        because the French sound system is so different from the English one.
        Once you have studied the sounds of French, the conversation you just
        heard will become more accessible to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Listening to similar words in the two languages will help you become
        aware of the differences in their sound systems. Listen to the
        following pairs of shared words. Can you hear a difference in the way
        words are stressed? In particular, can you hear the difference in the
        way the vowels are pronounced?

      <h3>Comparing English and French</h3>

      <div class="sidebar">
        <h3>
          Note Culturelle :<br />
          The Norman Conquest
        </h3>

        <p>
          The year 1066 was a turning point in history. William I, the
          Conqueror and his sons conquered England from their base in
          Normandy, fundamentally changing England's government, language, and
          social order. Norman feudalism became the basis for the conquerors'
          division of English lands among themselves. This gave England a new
          French aristocracy and a new social and political structure, ending
          England's previous Scandinavian ways.
        </p>

        <p>
          William the Conqueror imposed his native language, French, on
          England. As a result, French, a Romance language derived from Latin,
          became the language of the English upper class. The English kings
          spoke French as their native tongue, and not until the 14th century
          did the kings speak English. A revival of English culture did take
          place in the mid-12th century, but French remained the dominant
          language of Parliament and the law courts into the 13th century.
          French has so influenced the English vocabulary that, even though
          English is a Germanic language, English speakers today recognize the
          meanings of more French words than German words.
        </p>

        <h4>Talk About It</h4>

        <p>
          With a partner, make a list of English words that you think may have
          been borrowed from French. Check your answers with a dictionary or
          online.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        As a result of their shared history, the English and French languages
        share many characteristics. When the Duke of Normandy, known as
        William the Conqueror, won the Battle of Hastings in 1066, England
        fell under the domination of the Normans, and Norman French, the
        dialect of Normandy, became the language of the court, the educational
        system, and the administration. French words flooded into the English
        language and the English vocabulary became distinct from the
        vocabularies of other Germanic languages such as Dutch, Swedish, or
        German, which borrowed far less extensively from French.
      </p>

      <p>
        This intermingling of English and French early in the 11th century
        explains why many words look the same today. However, they rarely
        sound the same. Stress in English is achieved through an increase in
        volume. In the English word <em>bureau,</em> the first syllable is
        louder than the second. In French, the last syllable is made louder to
        achieve emphasis. In French, stress results from an elongated vowel
        sound in the final syllable of the word and is always on the last
        syllable of a phrase. Listen to the pairs again, paying careful
        attention to stress and to the sounds of the vowels.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Stress has a lot to do with how vowels sound in the two languages. In
        English, stressed vowels are longer than unstressed vowels. The word
        <em>chocolate</em> offers a good example. The second
        <em>o</em> disappears and the <em>a</em> becomes an indistinct sound,
        something between the <em>i</em> of <em>bit</em> and the<em> u</em> of
        <em>but.</em> In the French word <b>chocolat</b><em>, </em>each of the
        three vowels is distinct. Listen to the pairs again, paying careful
        attention to the differences between the vowels of the two languages.

      <h3>French Vowels and Consonants</h3>
      <p>
        Vowels are very important in French and their pronunciation requires
        much more muscle than English vowels. The next part of
        <b>Préparation 1</b> will examine French vowels and provide
        pronunciation exercises.
      </p>
      <h4>Vowels</h4>
      <p>
        The letter <b>a</b> in French represents a sound close to the
        <em>a</em> of <em>class</em> in standard American English. Example:
        salade, sardine, appétit
      </p>
      <p class="audio-player">
        <audio controls="" src="../audio/frchc104.mp3"></audio>
      </p>

      <p>
        The sound spelled <b>é</b> in French represents a vowel close to the
        <em>ai</em> of English <em>bait</em>, but shorter and tenser, with no
        y-like glide. It is sometimes written <b>er</b> at the end of a word.
        Example: sautée, dîner, soufflé, appétit
      </p>
      <p class="audio-player">
        <audio controls="" src="../audio/frchc105.mp3"></audio>
      </p>

      <p>
        French has a vowel close to the <em>e</em> of English <em>bed</em>.
        This sound is spelled in various ways in French, among them <b>ai</b>,
        <b>ê</b>, <b>è</b>, and <b>ei</b>. Example: vinaigre, pêche
      </p>
      <p class="audio-player">
        <audio controls="" src="../audio/frchc106.mp3"></audio>
      </p>

      <p>
        The letter <b>i</b> represents a vowel close to the <em>i</em> of
        English <em>machine</em>, but shorter and tenser. Note that the letter
        <b>i <em>never</em></b> represents the sound of <em>i</em> in English
        <em>bit</em>. Example: sardine, appétit, figue, biscuit
      </p>
      <p class="audio-player">
        <audio controls="" src="../audio/frchc107.mp3"></audio>
      </p>

      <p>
        The sounds spelled <b>au</b> or <b>o</b> in French represent a vowel
        close to the <em>oa</em> of English <em>boat</em>, but shorter and
        tenser, with no glide at the end. Example: sautée, sauce
      </p>
      <p class="audio-player">
        <audio controls="" src="../audio/frchc108.mp3"></audio>
      </p>

      <p>
        Often in the interior of a word the letter <b>o</b> represents a vowel
        close to the <em>au</em> of English <em>taught</em>. This sound is
        called open <b>o</b>. Example: chocolat
      </p>
      <p class="audio-player">
        <audio controls="" src="../audio/frchc109.mp3"></audio>
      </p>

      <p>
        The letters <b>ou</b> represent a vowel close to the <em>oo</em> of
        English <em>food</em>, but shorter and much tenser. Example: mousse,
        moutarde, soupe, soufflé.
      </p>
      <p class="audio-player">
        <audio controls="" src="../audio/frchc110.mp3"></audio>
      </p>

      <h4>Nasal Vowels</h4>
      <p>French also has three nasal vowels.</p>
      <p>
        One is a sound similar to the <em>o</em> of <em>hot</em> in standard
        American English. Examples: agent, champagne
      </p>
      <p class="audio-player">
        <audio controls="" src="../audio/frchc111.mp3"></audio>
      </p>

      <p>
        The second is a sound similar to the <em>oa</em> of <em>boat</em>.
        Examples: station, coton
      </p>
      <p class="audio-player">
        <audio controls="" src="../audio/frchc112.mp3"></audio>
      </p>

      <p>
        The third is a sound similar to the <em>e</em> of <em>bed</em>.
        Example: bassin, soudain
      </p>
      <p class="audio-player">
        <audio controls="" src="../audio/frchc113.mp3"></audio>
      </p>

      <h4>French Consonants</h4>
      <p>
        Vowels are not the only new sounds you will be learning to pronounce.
        French uses some of the consonants we use in English to produce
        certain distinct sounds:
      </p>
      <p>
        In French, the letters <b>ch</b> represent a sound similar to the
        <em>sh</em> in English <em>short</em>. Like most French consonants,
        this sound is pronounced with more tension of the articulatory muscles
        than its English counterpart. Examples: champagne, chocolat, pêche
      </p>
      <p class="audio-player">
        <audio controls="" src="../audio/frchc114.mp3"></audio>
      </p>

      <p>
        In French, when the letters <b>j</b> or <b>g</b> appear before the
        vowels <b>e</b> and <b>i</b>, they represent sounds similar to the
        <em>s</em> in English <em>pleasure</em>. Like French <b>ch</b>, this
        sound is pronounced with more tension of the articulatory muscles than
        its English counterpart. Examples: agent, jeter
      </p>
      <p class="audio-player">
        <audio controls="" src="../audio/frchc115.mp3"></audio>
      </p>

      <div class="details-wrapper">
        <details>
          <summary>Pronunciation Practice 2</summary>

          <p>
            Listen to the following French words that have become part of the
            English language.
          </p>
          <p class="audio-player">
            <audio controls="" src="../audio/frchc116.mp3"></audio>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>champagne</li>
            <li>agent</li>
            <li>centre</li>
            <li>station</li>
            <li>coton</li>
            <li>bassin</li>
            <li>soudain (sudden)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Note that nasal sounds in French spelling are almost always
            followed directly by an <b>n</b> (or sometimes <b>m</b>) when the
            <b>n</b> (or <b>m</b>) itself is directly followed by a different
            consonant. This is also true when the <b>n</b> or <b>m</b> is the
            last letter of a word.

          <summary>Pronunciation Review</summary>

          <p>
            Let's review the sounds we have learned by practicing some
            familiar material. As explained earlier many French phrases and
            expressions have also made their way into English. With what you
            now know about French sounds you should be able to pronounce these
            familiar words and phrases the way the French do. Repeat each one
            after the speaker. There will be two repetitions of each.

          <h4>Sounds Unique to French</h4>

          <p>
            Some of the French expressions that you have just repeated include
            new sounds that are common in French but nonexistent in English.
            Read the explanations below and listen to these words and phrases
            again:
          </p>

          <p>
            The letter <b>u</b>, in French spelling, represents a vowel that
            is pronounced by keeping your tongue in position for [<b>i</b>]
            but saying [<b>u</b>]. In other words, you round your lips while
            keeping your tongue high in the front of your mouth. Example: nom
            de plume
          </p>

          <p class="audio-player">
            <audio controls="" src="../audio/frchc117a.mp3"></audio>
          </p>

          <p>
            The letters <b>eu</b> represent a vowel sound that is pronounced
            by keeping your tongue in position for [<b>e</b>] but saying
            [<b>o</b>], in other words, you round your lips while keeping the
            tip of your tongue at mid-height in the front of your mouth.
            Example: adieu
          </p>

          <p class="audio-player">
            <audio controls="" src="../audio/frchc117b.mp3"></audio>
          </p>

          <p>
            French also has a vowel that is a more open version of the vowel
            represented by <b>eu</b> in <b>adieu</b>. This vowel is pronounced
            like the <b>e</b> of bed, but pronounced with rounded lips. This
            sound is represented either by <b>e</b> or by <b>eu</b> in French
            spelling. When it is represented by <b>e</b> it may be
            unpronounced in certain positions. When represented by <b>eu</b>,
            it is never unpronounced. Examples: nom de plume, nom de guerre,
            un je ne sais quoi
          </p>

          <p class="audio-player">
            <audio controls="" src="../audio/frchc117c.mp3"></audio>
          </p>

          <p>
            Did you notice that in <b>un je ne sais quoi</b>, this sound,
            called <b>mute e</b>, is not pronounced in the word <b>ne</b>?
          </p>

          <h3>Listen Again</h3>

          <p>
            Now listen again to the introductory conversation between two
            French people. What are they talking about? What specific items do
            they mention? Is your impression of normal spoken French any
            different now from what it was when you heard this conversation
            for the first time?

        let’s learn how people of college age say hello to each other in an
        informal situation. As you practice the sentences of the
        <b>Conversations</b> in <b>Préparation 1</b>, keep in mind what you
        have learned about French vowels and consonants. Listen and repeat the
        phrases. Remember, you can click on any sentence to go to the
        <b>Analyse</b> section where you will find a breakdown and analysis of
        the elements of the sentence. In the <b>Analyse</b> sections, all
        words, phrases, and sentences are given in French and English.
      </p>
      <h3>How to Proceed</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Listen to the entire conversation.</li>
        <li>
          Listen to the conversation sentence-by-sentence, studying the
          <strong>Analyse</strong> section as you listen. Concentrate first on
          the sounds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Listen to the conversation again, concentrating on the meaning of
          the different words and phrases that make up the conversation.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the pauses provided, repeat each sentence after the speaker. This
          should be done over and over until you are comfortable with each
          sentence.

      <h3>French Ways of Greeting</h3>
      <p>
        In both formal and informal situations, the most common gesture
        associated with greetings in French is the handshake. In France,
        adults and young people who are not close friends usually shake hands
        each time they meet and say good-bye.
      </p>
      <p>
        A handshake is also used when one is introduced to someone. The French
        handshake consists of a light, firm grasp with a slight upward stroke,
        then one downward stroke — unlike the American handshake, which often
        includes vigorous pumping up and down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among young people a kiss on the cheek or both cheeks is a common
        greeting. This kiss is called <b>la bise</b> and is used among young
        adult women of any age who are friends as well as between women and
        men. In more formal situations a handshake is used instead of the
        <b>bise</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two ways to say <em>hello</em> in <b>Conversation 1</b>,
        <b>bonjour</b> and <b>salut</b> are not entirely interchangeable.
        <b>Bonjour</b> is appropriate in all situations, whether formal or
        informal, while <b>salut</b> is colloquial and informal.
        <b>Salut</b> is common among young people.
      </p>

          <h4>Liaison</h4>

          <p>Final consonants in French words are usually not pronounced:</p>

          <p class="audio-player">
            <audio controls="" src="../audio/frchc126.mp3"></audio>
          </p>

            <li>moment</li>
            <li>très</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            However, in many cases, when the next word begins with a vowel,
            the final consonant is pronounced, but as part of the following
            word.
          </p>

          <p>
            The syllable <b>zo</b> comprises the final consonant of
            <b>très</b> and the initial vowel of <b>occupée</b>. When the
            final consonant of one word is joined to the initial vowel of the
            following word to form a single syllable, this is called
            <b>liaison</b>, which means <i>linking</i>. In <b>liaison</b>,
            Note that the <b>s</b> of <b>très</b>, which is usually silent, in
            <b>liaison</b> is pronounced like the <i>z</i> of <i>zoo</i>.

          <summary>Pronunciation Practice 4</summary>

          <p>
            Now let's practice French vowels and the rhythm of French
            sentences. Repeat the following phrases after the speaker. Don't
            worry about the meaning of the phrase. Concentrate on making each
            vowel clear and each syllable the same length. In each case you
            will hear a build-up of syllables. Notice that French sentences
            consist of a series of syllables of the same length, as opposed to
            English sentences, where stressed syllables are much longer than
            unstressed ones.

          <h3>Note on Liaison</h3>

          <p>
            Notice that Conversation 3 has two cases of
            <b>liaison</b> of [<b>s</b>] as [<b>z</b>]: <i>vous êtes</i> and
            <i>très heureuse</i>.

      <h2>Langue et Culture 2</h2>
      <h3>French Ways of Greeting (2)</h3>
      <p>
        Notice that in formal situations courtesy titles (<b>Monsieur</b>,
        <b>Madame</b>, <b>Mademoiselle</b>) are used. In America, people use
        the family name after the courtesy title (<em>Mr., Mrs., Ms., </em>etc.): <em>Good morning, Mrs. Smith.</em>
        In France, however, the courtesy title is used alone, without the
        family name:
        <b>Bonjour</b>, <b>Madame</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In France, two adults who don’t know each other very well always use
        courtesy titles. For instance, in a store the salesperson and the
        client would say <b>Bonjour, Madame</b>. In America, it is perfectly
        proper for a child to greet an adult by saying <em>Hi!</em> or<em>
          Hello!</em>
        In France, a child or a young adult greeting an older person who is
        not a relative is expected to use a courtesy title:<em> </em><b>Bonjour, Mademoiselle</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice how many times the courtesy titles are used in
        <b>Conversation 3.</b> Sentences such as <b>Enchanté</b>,
        <b>Madame</b> or <b>Merci</b>, <b>Madame</b> would sound inappropriate
        without <b>Madame</b>. In English the equivalent courtesy title would
        be superfluous in these cases.

      <h2>Structure de la Langue 1: French Accents</h2>
      <h3>Diacriticals</h3>
      <p>
        Diacriticals are marks, such as accent marks, that appear with
        letters. You may have noticed while reading the French words that some
        French letters used with marks above or below them. These accent marks
        are part of the spelling and indicate aspects of pronunciation. The
        four main accents are, with their French and English names:
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 2em">
        <span style="font-size: x-large; font-weight: bold">´</span> : accent
        aigu (acute accent)
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 2em">
        <span style="font-size: x-large; font-weight: bold">`</span> : accent
        grave (grave accent)
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 2em">
        <span style="font-size: x-large; font-weight: bold">ˆ</span> : accent
        circonflexe (circumflex)
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 2em">
        <span style="font-size: x-large; font-weight: bold">¸</span> : cédille
        (cedilla)
      </p>

      <h4>Accent aigu</h4>
      <p>
        The <b>accent aigu</b> occurs only over the letter <b>e</b>: <b>é</b>.
        This letter is called <b>é accent aigu</b>. The letter
        <b>é</b> indicates that the <b>e</b> represents the sound called
        closed <b>é</b> as in <b>présent, ressé</b>.
      </p>
      <h4>Accent grave</h4>
      <p>
        The <b>accent grave</b> usually appears over the letter <b>e</b>:
        <b>è</b>. This letter is called <b>e accent grave</b>. It indicates
        that the <b>e</b> represents the sound [<b>è</b>] as in <b>très</b>.
        The <b>accent grave</b> appears over the letter <b>a</b> in the
        preposition <b>à</b> and over the letter <b>u</b> in the word
        <b>où</b>, <em>where</em>.
      </p>
      <h4>Circonflexe</h4>
      <p>
        The <b>circonflexe</b> may appear over any vowel. When it appears over
        <b>e</b>, the <b>ê</b> is pronounced like the <em>e</em> of English
        <em>bet</em>. In colloquial French, the <b>circonflexe</b> does not
        change the pronunciation of the other vowels (<b>a</b>, <b>i</b>,
        <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>).
      </p>
      <h4>Cédille</h4>
      <p>
        The <b>cédille</b> can only appear under the letter <b>c</b>:
        <b>ç</b>. This letter is called <b>ç cédille</b>. The letter
        <b>ç</b> is pronounced like the <em>s</em> of English
        <em>soup</em> and is used before the vowels <b>a</b>, <b>o</b>, and
        <b>u</b>. The letter <b>c</b> without the <b>cédille</b> is pronounced
        like the <em>c</em> of English <em>cool</em> before the vowels <b>a</b><em>, </em><b>o</b><em>, </em>and<em>
        </em><b>u</b>, but like the
        <em>s</em> of English <em>soup</em> before <b>e</b> and <b>i</b>:
        <b>merci Nicole</b>, <b>ça</b>, <b>connaissance</b>.
      </p>

      <h2>Structure de la Langue 2: Spoken vs. Written French</h2>
      <p>
        You have probably noticed that many French words change their form
        depending on whether they refer to a man or a woman. Some of these
        changes are reflected in pronunciation and spelling.
      </p>

      <p class="audio-player">
        <audio controls="" src="../audio/frchc151.mp3"></audio>
      </p>

      <div class="one-grid">
        <div>Je suis heureux. (man speaking)</div>
        <div>Je suis heureuse. (woman speaking)</div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Other adjectives, such as <b>pressé</b>, <em> in a hurry,</em> have
        changes in form that are reflected in spelling, but not in
        pronunciation:
      </p>

      <p class="audio-player">
        <audio controls="" src="../audio/frchc152.mp3"></audio>
      </p>

      <div class="one-grid">
        <div>Je suis pressé (man speaking)</div>
        <div>Je suis pressée. (woman speaking)</div>
        <div>Nous sommes pressés. (men speaking)</div>
        <div>Nous sommes pressées. (women speaking)</div>
      </div>

      <p>
        The adjective <b>pressé</b> has four written forms: <b>pressé</b>,
        <b>pressée</b>, <b>pressés</b> and <b>pressées</b>, but only one form
        in speech.
      </p>
      <p>Now look at the adjective <b>occupé</b>.</p>

      <p class="audio-player">
        <audio controls="" src="../audio/frchc153.mp3"></audio>
      </p>

      <div class="one-grid">
        <div>Je suis occupé. (man speaking)</div>
        <div>Je suis occupée. (woman speaking)</div>
        <div>Nous sommes occupés. (men speaking)</div>
        <div>Nous sommes occupées. (women speaking)</div>
      </div>

      <p>
        How many written forms does the adjective <b>occupé</b> have? How many
        spoken forms would you guess it has?
      </p>

              <li>The Eiffel Tower (in French, la Tour Eiffel)</li>
              <li>
                Gustave Eiffel (1832-1923), the engineer who designed the
                Eiffel Tower. The Tower, a metal structure, was completed in
                1889 and is 320 meters (about 1,050 feet) high. Today the
                Eiffel Tower is perhaps the most well-known symbol of the city
                of Paris, but when it was built for the 1889 World’s Fair, it
                called forth a storm of criticism that condemned it as a
                blight on the beauty of the city. Today over 170 million
                people visit the Eiffel Tower each year to enjoy the
                spectacular views of Paris from the observation deck at the
                top.
              </li>
              <li>
                He is building the Eiffel Tower by himself. The actual
                construction of la Tour Eiffel employed over 200 workers, half
                of whom made the iron girders while the other half worked on
                the tower.

          Note Culturelle : <br />
          The University System in France
        </h2>

        <p>
          Today, more than ever, the French university system is under
          scrutiny from both political and educational perspectives. One major
          complaint regarding the system is that since the late 19th century,
          when it was first created, the university system has undergone
          little change. Unlike secondary education in France, which has
          maintained a formidable reputation worldwide, the university system
          in France has been criticized frequently.
        </p>

        <p>
          Contrary to universities in most industrialized countries, French
          universities are public and open to all. Any student who has passed
          the <b>baccalauréat</b> can, if he or she wishes, enroll in the
          university of his or her choice. In the first year, the student
          chooses a subject in which he or she will specialize; upon
          completion of his/her studies, the student receives a diploma. The
          tuition in French universities is virtually free - the student must
          generally pay registration fees of around 800 French francs (the
          equivalent of $130). The fees for the university are entirely paid
          by the state. From the 1800s to the 1950s, the university system in
          France functioned very well because the number of students enrolled
          in the university was very limited.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the past 30 years, studies have become progressively more
          democratic. The number of applicants to the universities has
          increased rapidly, and, as a result, universities have found
          themselves unable to effectively serve a massive number of with more
          personalized attention. French universities have not been well
          prepared for the influx of applicants, most of whom pursue advanced
          degrees in order to obtain better jobs. The number of students is so
          great that university diplomas like the
          <b>Diplôme d'études universitaires générales (DEUG)</b> or the
          <b>Licence</b> (degree following the <b>DEUG</b> and preceding the
          <b>Maîtrise</b>) no longer have the same value in the job market,
          even though the level of education remains at the highest level in
          most French universities. Successive French governments have refused
          to reform the system or institute a system to counteract student
          unions that are very influential in driving educational and
          political debates. Universities are therefore condemned for lacking
          a means to resolve these issues.

        <p>
          In response to this problem in the university system, preparatory
          classes have been developed to seek out academically advanced
          students. These prep courses are classes in which the best students
          prepare for entrance exams for prestigious universities, such as
          <b>l'École polytechnique</b> and <b>l'École normale supérieure</b>.
          The number of students admitted in these classes is very limited and
          the selection of students by the university is based on their
          performance. Once admitted, students study in small classes. These
          schools are not universities; they offer a superior level of
          education and are generally public and free. The prestige of these
          schools and of those who attend them is such that graduates
          generally have little difficulty finding good employment. The
          feeling at these schools is very different from that of the
          university - the competition and the work are exceptionally
          rigorous.

        <p>
          The French university system is composed of two systems with very
          different sentiments: on the one hand, there is the university,
          which offers education to a large majority of students; on the other
          hand, there are schools that tend to be more elitist and offer
          education to an extremely limited number of students. The
          construction of the university system is a subject of enormous
          debate in the political world because the selective way in which
          students are picked for the more prestigious schools is perceived as
          unfair. Hence, the subject of the French university system is a very
          sensitive one that the French government has yet to resolve.
